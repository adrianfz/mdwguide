# 	Challenge 5 -- Analytics Migration

[<Previous Challenge](/Host/Guide/Challenge4/README.md)

## Introduction

WWI leadership team wants to leverage Power BI modeling capability to create analytic data models from the data in Azure Synapse Analytics (ASA). Next, they want to empower different analysts from different organizations to use Power BI reporting capability and build out analytics reports and dashboards from those data models. The final solution needs to consider both report design as well as optimal response times.  Dashboards need to return in less 5 seconds.

## Description
The objective of this lab is to build out a tabular model and Power BI reports.  BI analysts will use Power BI Desktop to build out this model and reports.  At the beginning the performance is suboptimal and you will need to tune the model, optimize the database and redesign the reports.

## Power BI Tuning Steps
1. Open first Power BI pbix file 'WWI_Sales' as your first Direct query report. Open the Page 1 first as blank page.
2. Leverage the tool within Power BI called 'Performance Analyzer' under 'View' tool tab. Once the 'Performance analyzer Panel showed up on right. Click on 'Start recording'. Then Click on each page and record query durations. Record baseline for each page.
3. You can download the query from 'Performance Analyzer' and then it will show the SQL query generated by each visual. 
4. Copy the longest running query and paste to SSMS.
5. Go to SSMS and run the query from above step. 
6. Use the result cache setting TSQL query and turn the result cache on/off. Record new response times
7. Open the second pbix file 'WWI_Sales_Composite' and show the student on the Dimensional Table property 'Storage Mode'
8. Use performance analyzer to compare the model performance
